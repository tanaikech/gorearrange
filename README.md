# Description
Since I couldn't find CLI tools for manually rearranging text data, I created this CLI tool. For this, at first, I created [a Golang library go-rearrange](https://github.com/tanaikech/go-rearrange/).

# Install
Download an executable file from [the release page](https://github.com/tanaikech/gorearrange/releases) and put to a directory with path.

or

Use go get.

~~~bash
$ go get -u github.com/tanaikech/gorearrange
~~~

This CLI tool uses [termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go) and [go-rearrange](https://github.com/tanaikech/go-rearrange/).

# Usage
Basically, you can use gorearrange as follows.

~~~
$ cat sample.txt | gorearrange
~~~

You can use the standard output ``>`` to output the result as a file. If you use the command prompt on windows dos, please use ``type sample.txt | gorearrange``.

or

~~~
$ gorearrange -i sample.txt
~~~

For example, if you use msys2, you can use ``winpty gorearrange -i sample.txt``. You can use an option ``-o outputfile`` to output the result as a file.
